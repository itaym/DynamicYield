Web Developer Take Home Exam
Introduction
You made it this far, it means we think you’re an awesome person. Now it’s time to prove that
you’re an awesome developer!
First things first, relax and breathe deeply. Read through the assignment in detail, this is your
chance to shine!
Assignment
For this assignment you'll be developing a simple scheduling application to manage the
booking of 3 meeting rooms (Rooms A, B, C, or any other names you'd like to use) throughout
a weekly schedule.
This assignment is meant to show us your core development skills. This code is not going to
production, so the use of reasonable shortcuts for the sake of simplicity are accepted.
However, we still expect your code to be clean, clear, documented where needed and to use
industry-acceptable best practices.
Use your Ninja coding skills to implement the following capabilities:
1. The user can log in & out
2. The user goes through some form of authentication before being able to access the app*
3. The user can create additional users
4. A simple weekly overview of the booking status of each room.
5. A way to see who's booking a specific room at a specific time.
6. Add, edit and remove room reservations based on current availability.
7. Any other functionality you'd like to add.
* Note: For authentication please do something simple. No need to implement the latest
elaborate oauth2 authentication, unless you want to show off. Also no need to implement any
permissions scheme. All users have the same permissions. Storing name and clear text
password in the database is fine. It's a bad practice, but we're keeping it simple. This code is not
going to production.
Use React, Node, and your pick of a database. Use your pick of a framework to handle state.
